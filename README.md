This web application is used to create a password from randomly selected letters, numbers, and special characters. The user may define which groups they wish to include in the password, choosing among lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The user is then prompted to give a desired length to the password, limited between 8 and 128 characters. Once the password it may be copy/pasted, and once the *Generate Password* button is clicked again the process starts over.
